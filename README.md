The goal of this venture is to develop models capable of completing a variety of autonomous tasks within the Carla simulator using reinforcement learning methods. The repository is divided into two distinct projects which are still being developed.

# A to B
Autonomous ride from point A to B.
Trained models (see A_to_B/final_models) are able to correctly perform fundamental road manoeuvres such as driving straight, turning left and right.
Using this knowledge, the models can learn how to beat any scenario in a reasonable amount of time, depending on the scenario's complexity.

Examples of some fundamental road manoeuvres:
